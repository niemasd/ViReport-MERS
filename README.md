This repository contains a molecular epidemiological report on a collection of 174 human and 100 camel MERS-CoV sequences produced by [ViReport](https://github.com/niemasd/ViReport) using data obtained from [Dudas *et al*. (2018)](https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.31257). The camel sequences were used to infer and root the viral phylogeny, but they were removed by ViReport as "outgroups" (an optional feature) to highlight the history of the epidemic in humans.
* You can access the most up-to-date Markdown version of the report here: **[Report.md](Report.md)**
    * You can also access equivalent HTML and PDF versions here: **[Report.html](Report.html)** and **[Report.pdf](Report.pdf)**
* You can access the input sample dates here: **[input_files](input_files)**
* You can access the output files from the analyses here: **[output_files](output_files)**
* You can access all intermediate files from the analyses here: **[intermediate_files](intermediate_files)**

Note that this is still using a ***very*** early version of [ViReport](https://github.com/niemasd/ViReport), so the aesthetics of the report will improve significantly in the next few weeks.
